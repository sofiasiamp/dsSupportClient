# datashieldDescriptives

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

These R client-side functions where created to help automate the production of descriptive statistics by running already existing DataSHIELD functions on any number of harmonized datasets.

## Installation

First, you need to install the "remotes" package from CRAN:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
```
And then install this Github repository
``` r
remotes::install_github("sofiasiamp/dsSupportClient")
```

## Example

This is a basic example on how to use it:

```{r example}
#library(dsSupportClient)
#ds.wrapper(ds_function = ds.class, datasources = connections, df = "D")
```
