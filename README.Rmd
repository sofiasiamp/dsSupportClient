The `dsSupportClient` package offers a set of client-side functions that wrap around DataSHIELD functions from `dsBase`.  It is designed to streamline the production of descriptive statistics across multiple harmonized datasets. Some functions are still in development and may be refined based on user feedback.

## Installation

First, you need to install the "remotes" package from CRAN:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
```
And then install this Github repository
``` r
remotes::install_github("sofiasiamp/dsSupportClient")
```

## Example

This is a basic example on how to use it:

```r
library(dsSupportClient)
ds.wrapper(ds_function = ds.class, datasources = connections, df = "D")
```
